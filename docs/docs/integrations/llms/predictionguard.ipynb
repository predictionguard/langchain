       "\" Justin Bieber was born on March 1, 1994. Super Bowl XXVIII was held on January 30, 1994. Since the Super Bowl happened before the year of Justin Bieber's birth, we need to look at the winner of Super Bowl XXVIII. The winner of Super Bowl XXVIII was the Dallas Cowboys. Therefore, the NFL team that won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Bieber was born is the Dallas Cowboys. \\n\\nFinal answer: Dallas Cowboys. \\n\\nExplanation: To find the answer, we first identified the year of Justin Bieber's birth (1994) and then looked at the Super Bowl that took place in that year (Super Bowl XXVIII). From there, we determined the winner of that Super Bowl (Dallas Cowboys) and concluded that the Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Bieber was born. \\n\\nNote: This question requires knowledge of the year Justin Bieber was born, the year Super Bowl XXVIII took place, and the winner of that Super Bowl. It also requires the ability to connect these pieces of information to arrive at the final answer. \\n\\nAdditional Information: \\n\\n- Justin Bieber is a Canadian singer and songwriter who rose to fame in the late 2000s. \\n- Super Bowl XX\""
